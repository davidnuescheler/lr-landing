## See all you can do with your photos — at your desk or on the go.
Create incredible photos anywhere with Lightroom and 1TB of cloud storage. The app offers powerful photo editing features in an easy-to-use interface. Adjust your full-resolution shots and have both your originals and edits backed up to the cloud. Organize with searchable keywords that are automatically applied without the hassle of tagging. And easily share and showcase your photos in fun ways.

## Anywhere editing.

With easy-to-use photo editing tools like sliders and filters, Lightroom makes it simple to create photos that look just the way you want. And you can edit your full-resolution photos anywhere — on mobile devices, the web, or your desktop. Edits on one device are automatically applied everywhere else

## Smarter organization.

Adobe Sensei uses machine learning to recognize the people and other content in your photos and then applies searchable keywords automatically. Looking for shots of your cousin or favorite trips to the water? Auto-tagging makes searching a snap so you can create albums based on any person or theme you want.

## Worry-free storage.

Starting at 1TB with options for more, the cloud storage in Lightroom ensures that you can access your entire library of full-resolution photos anytime you want, anywhere you are, from any device.

## Easy sharing.

Share your photographs with loved ones, clients, or an even bigger audience. Post photos directly to social sites. Showcase them on your website by sending them directly to Adobe Portfolio from Lightroom on your desktop. Create stunning graphics, web pages, and video stories in minutes with Adobe Spark. It's all included in your membership.
